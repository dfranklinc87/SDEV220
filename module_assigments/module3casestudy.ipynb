    "Write a Python app that has the following classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A super class called Vehicle, which contains an attribute for vehicle type, such as car, truck, plane, boat, or a broomstick.\n",
    "    A class called Automobile which will inherit the attributes from Vehicle and also contain the following attributes:\n",
    "        year\n",
    "        make\n",
    "        model\n",
    "        doors (2 or 4)\n",
    "        roof (solid or sun roof).\n",
    "    Write an app that will accept user input for a car. The app will store \"car\" into the vehicle type in your Vehicle super class. \n",
    "    The app will then ask the user for the year, make, model, doors, and type of roof and store thdata in the attributes above.\n",
    "    The app will then output the data in an easy-to-read and understandable format, such as this:\n",
    "      Vehicle type: car\n",
    "      Year: 2022\n",
    "      Make: Toyota\n",
